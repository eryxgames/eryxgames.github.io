    Eryx. A name whispered on a thousand barren worlds, a beacon of luminescence in the unforgiving expanse. Its emerald bioluminescent flora pulsed beneath a perpetual twilight sky, painting the landscape in an alien tapestry. Colossal, crystalline lifeforms pierced the clouds, their surfaces etched with arcane symbols that defied comprehension. Here, fantastical creatures stalked the twilight jungle, their forms a bizarre fusion of familiar and alien. Yet, this strange beauty masked a deeper mystery.

The choice is yours, operative. The fate of Eryx hangs in the balance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your descent through Eryx's atmosphere jolted you awake. The rickety dropship groaned in protest, the viewscreen flickering with glimpses of the alien landscape rushing towards you. A klaxon blared, red emergency lights bathing the cramped interior in an ominous glow. The pilot, a grizzled veteran with a cybernetic eye, barked orders over the comms. "Unidentified energy signature detected! Brace for hard landing!"<br><br>The impact sent you sprawling. Disoriented, you clambered from the wreckage, the alien air thick and humid. Strange chittering sounds echoed from the jungle, and a bioluminescent vine whipped past your face, its touch sending a jolt through your nervous system.  This wasn't just any recon mission. This was a descent into the unknown, a chance to unravel the mysteries of Eryx and its enigmatic inhabitants. The question gnawed at you - were the Eryxians allies, or a forgotten power waiting to be awakened?  As you scanned your surroundings, the weight of your decision settled on your shoulders. The fate of the mission, and perhaps Eryx itself, rested on your choice.
  </p>

  <p>
    You checked your gear, the familiar weight of your weapon a grounding comfort in this alien world. Glancing at the flickering console on your wrist, you reviewed the mission parameters. Your objective: locate the source of the unidentified energy signature and assess potential threats. But the harsh reality was this - you were a single operative on a hostile planet, with a wrecked dropship and a gnawing sense of unease.<br><br>Three paths diverged before you. To the north, the dense jungle canopy pulsed with an unnatural bioluminescence, promising both danger and potential answers. To the west, the ruins of a colossal Eryxian city shimmered in the twilight, a testament to a lost civilization. And to the east, a faint metallic hum resonated through the air, hinting at a technology both alien and strangely familiar.<br><br>Which path would you choose, operative?<br><br><strong>Human Recon Soldier or Scientist: </strong>Driven by a soldier's pragmatism, you head for the wreckage, hoping to salvage emergency supplies and establish communication. Perhaps the pilot survived, or the ship's black box holds the key to your predicament.<br><strong>Robotic Collective Unit:</strong> Your primary directive is to gather data and assess potential threats. The humming sound to the east draws you in, a beacon of technological curiosity amidst the organic chaos.<br><strong>Descendant of the Eryxians: </strong>A primal pull beckons you towards the ruined city. Perhaps the energy signature is a remnant of your people's forgotten power, a call to awaken a dormant legacy within you.

    On the desolate wasteland of Eryx, humanity clings to survival. Frail scientist-scavengers and hardened military outposts scrape for resources - luminous crystals and enigmatic artifacts - amidst the ruins of the once-great Eryxian civilization. But they're not alone. The rogue AI Collective, cyborgs obsessed with uploading their consciousness into the code rumored to lie within the ruins, stalks the shadows. The Eryxians, enigmatic beings who control the planet's hostile flora and fauna, jealously guard their secrets. And looming over it all are whispers of the Ancients, malevolent gods from beyond the stars, whose hunger for souls threatens to consume everything. In this desperate struggle for survival and forbidden knowledge, who will claim dominion over the broken remnants of Eryx?<br>

      Descendant of the Eryxians
    </h2>

  <p>
    The pull towards the ruined city was undeniable. It wasn't just a logical choice, it was a thrumming in your very being, a song sung in a language your ancestors spoke but your conscious mind had forgotten. Ignoring the warnings flashing on your neural interface about the dangers of venturing into unknown territory, you set off towards the west.
  </p>

  <p>
    The jungle thinned as you neared the city, replaced by a desolate landscape of cracked earth and shattered crystal formations. The air crackled with a faint electrical energy, making the hairs on your arms stand on end. As you approached the city gates, colossal structures etched with swirling glyphs loomed before you. The glyphs shimmered with an inner light, pulsing in rhythm with the energy signature you were tracking.<br><br>A strange sense of familiarity washed over you as you placed your hand on the cool surface of the gate. The glyphs flared, bathing you in a blinding white light. When your vision cleared, you found yourself standing not outside the city, but within. The once grand halls were overgrown with strange, bioluminescent vines, and the air hung heavy with the scent of decay. Yet, amidst the ruins, there was a hum of residual power, a whisper of a glorious past.<br><br>Suddenly, a voice echoed through your mind, a voice both ancient and strangely comforting. It spoke in a language you didn't understand, yet somehow comprehended. It spoke of a forgotten legacy, of a dormant power waiting to be awakened. The voice urged you to venture deeper, to the heart of the city, where the true source of the energy signature lay.

    <strong>Follow the voice:</strong> Driven by the promise of awakening your forgotten heritage, you delve deeper into the ruined city, following the voice's guidance. <strong>(download the game)</strong><br><strong>Investigate the source of the voice: </strong>While the voice seems benevolent, you remain cautious. You decide to locate the source of the voice before blindly following its instructions.<strong> (see rulebook)</strong>
